 The project involves creating a Python program to analyse album sales data from a CSV file. The program reads data, extracts artist and album names, classifies albums based on sales (Gold, Platinum, etc.), and outputs results to a .csv file. A batch script runs the program from the command line. 
 Place bestselling_albums_by_year_in_UK.csv, main.py, calculations.py, and run_program.bat in one folder.
Run batch-file.bat and check for “Program completed successfully.”
Verify output.csv has album classifications, best seller, top artists, and worst seller.
